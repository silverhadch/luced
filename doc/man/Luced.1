NAME

luced - Terminal Text Editor
(Still in Development)

SYNOPSIS

luced [filename]

luced [filename] [options]

DESCRIPTION

luced is a simple terminal-based text editor written in Python.
It opens a file for editing or creates a new file if it doesn't exist.
The editor also supports basic clipboard operations.
When run without arguments, luced starts the editor with a test buffer.
When run with a filename, luced will open the specified file or create it if it doesn't exist.
If run with root privileges using sudo, you will be reminded in the editor that you are operating as root.

OPTIONS

filename: The file to open or create.
If omitted, luced will start with a test buffer.

SPECIAL USAGE

sudo luced filename: Opens the editor with root privileges.
A warning will be displayed within the editor to inform you of the root access.

KEYBINDS

Ctrl-C: Kill the Editor
Ctrl-Q: Quit normally
Ctrl-S: Save File or create a new one if it doesn't exist
Arrows: Move the Cursor

Special Keybinds for Clipboard:

Alt-C: Copy (with mouse-selected text). Clipboard access requires sudo -E to be effective.
Ctrl-V: Paste

NOTES

If you are running luced as root, clipboard functionality is disabled due to the lack of the HOME environment variable.
To enable clipboard access, relaunch luced with sudo -E.
