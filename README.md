# Dependencies

'Python' and
'Python-pyperclip'

# Keybinds

Keybinds are on the downbar.

Here all:

'Ctrl-C' - Kill the Editor

'Ctrl-Q' - Quit normally

'Ctrl-S' - Save File or (Create New one if File doesnt exist)

'Arrows' - Move the Cursor

# Special Keybinds for Clipboard:

If running 'Luced' as root, the Clipboard is deactivated (because sudo doesnt export the HOME env variable for the Clipboard) unless you relaunch with sudo -E ... 

'Alt-C' - Copy (with mouse selected Text)

'Ctrl-V' - Paste 

# Install

The Binary/Executable are still being made with an Install script but if you can't wait git clone this repo and make an Path variable to luced/main.py and run with that variable and a file as an argument. (The File will be created automaticaly, if it doesnt exist
exist.)
